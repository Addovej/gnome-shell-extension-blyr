All transitions are animated using Tweener. So no "animate" setting is required anymore.
Every background needs its own blur effect because the shader uses the width and height of the actor to calculate the apropriate blur intensity.
Fortunately we can access the Clutter effect of the actor using .get_effect("name"); so we just have to keep a list of the actors.

panel_only = 2

	(possible switch case with old state (1,2 or 3) * 10 plus new state)
